Fastest way of cache for WordPress: memcached + nginx!

== Description ==
WP-FFPC ( WordPress Fast Full Page Cache ) is a cache plugin for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/ "WordPress").

= Features: =
* [NGiNX](http://NGiNX.org "NGiNX") compatibility
* Wordpress Network support ( for subdomain layout )
* cache exclude possibilities ( home, feeds, archieves, pages, singles )
* (optional) cache for logged-in users
* 404 caching
* canonical redirects caching
* Last Modified HTTP header support ( for 304 responses )
* shortlink HTTP header preservation
* pingback HTTP header preservation
* (optional) talkative log for troubleshooting
* multiple memcached upstream support

Many thanks for supporters, testers & bug reporters: [Eric Gilette](http://www.ericgillette.com/ "Eric Gilette"); [doconeill](http://wordpress.org/support/profile/doconeill "doconeill"); [Mark Costlow](mailto:cheeks@swcp.com "Mark Costlow").

Thanks for [Hyper Cache](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/hyper-cache "Hyper Cache") for beeing inspirational.

== Installation ==

1. Upload contents of `wp-ffpc.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Enable WordPress cache by adding `define('WP_CACHE',true);` in wp-config.php
3. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress ( site or Network wide )
4. Check the settings in `Settings` ( site or Network Admin, depending on activation wideness ) -> `WP-FFPC` menu in WordPress.
5. Save the settings. THIS STEP IS MANDATORY: without saving the settings, there will be no activated caching!

= Using the plugin with NGiNX =
If the storage engine is either PHP Memcache or PHP Memcached extension, the created entries can be read and served directly from NGiNX ( if it has memcache or memc extension )
A short configuration example is generated on the plugin settings page, under `NGiNX` tab according to the saved settings.
**NOTE:** Some features ( most of additional HTTP headers for example, like pingback, shortlink, etc. ) will not be available with this solution.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to use the plugin on Amazon Linux? =
You have to remove the default yum package, named `php-pecl-memcache` and install `Memcached` through PECL.

= How to use the plugin in a WordPress Network =
From version 1.0, the plugin supports subdomain based WordPress Network with possible different per site cache settings. If the plugin is network active, obviously the network wide settings will be used for all of the sites. If it's activated only on some of the sites, the other will not be affected and even the cache storage backend can be different from site to site.

= What are the plugin's requirements? =
* WordPress >= 3.0

and **at least one** of the following for storage backend:
* PHP APC
* PHP Memcached > 0.1.0
* PHP Memcache > 2.1.0

= How logging works in the plugin? =
Log levels ( if logging enabled ) includes warning and error level messages; error level most usually means PHP configuration error or missing plugin configuration.
Additional info level log is available as additional setting, but if log is disabled, so will info log as well.
All logs use syslog() PHP function, therefore it's presence is mandatory for loggin functionality.

= How can I contribute? =
In order to make contributions a lot easier, I've moved the plugin development to [GitHub](https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-ffpc "GitHub"), feel free to fork and put shiny, new things in it and get in touch with me [hello@petermolnar.eu](mailto:hello@petermolnar.eu "hello@petermolnar.eu") when you have it ready.

= 0.4.3 =
*2013.03.03*

* long-running %3C bug fixed by the help of Mark Costlow <cheeks@swcp.com>, many thanks for it. It was cause by a bad check in the default values set-up: is_numeric applies for string numbers as well, which was unknown to me, and cause some of the values to be 0 where they should have been something different.

* added warning message for memcache extension in binary mode

**KNOWN ISSUES**

There are major problems with the "memcache" driver, the source is yet unkown. The situation is that there's no response from the memcached server using this driver; please avoid using it!

= 0.4.1 =
*2012.08.16*

**KNOWN ISSUES**

* "memcache" extension fails in binary mode; the reason is under investigation
